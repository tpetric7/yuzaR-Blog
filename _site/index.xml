      <title>R demo | ANOVA (One-Way ) | Fisher's, Welch's, Bayesian, Robust</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2022-04-03-anova</link>
      <description>How does education influence our salary? ANOVA which is just the abbreviation for Analysis Of Variances you see on the thumbnail answeres this question with Frequentists and Bayesian tests. It also privides two different effect sizes, compares education levels pairwisely and even corrects p-values for multiple comparisons. ALL OF THAT is done by this simple command. So, in this blog-post you'll learn how to produce the statistically rich plot, you'll understand when to conduct Welch's ANOVA and when Fisher's ANOVA and you'll know how to interpret every little detail on this plot. Lets get into it.</description>

      <description>If we have ordinal or not-normally distributed data, ANOVA might produce a wrong result. That's why we need Kruskal-Wallis test. Kruskal-Wallis test you see on the screen answers two question (1) whether at least one group is different from other groups and (2) between which groups exactly this difference is. So, let's learn how to get and interpret all these results.</description>

      <title>Tidy data (in progress, but really in progress mate ;)</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2022-04-22-tidydata</link>
      <description>Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, visualise, analyse and they don't interrapt the process. It's like not cooking three dished upfront for the dinner, but preparing one, eating it then needing to get up and cook again, before you continue eating. So, tidying up your data requires some upfront work, but that work pays off in the long term.</description>

      <title>R demo | Cochran’s Q Test + Pairwise McNemar Tests (post-hoc)</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-04-cochran</link>
      <description>Cochran test is an extension of the McNemar test for comparing MORE than two PAIRED categorical samples in which the same individuals appear in each sample. If Cochran test is significant, we'd need to compare samples among each other pairwisely with McNemar tests. So, let's do that.</description>

      <description>Comparing two groups with not-normally disctributed or ordinal data is the reason we need Mann-Whitney U Test instead of t-Test. So, today we'll learn (1) how to conduct and visualize Mann-Whitney U Test you saw on the thumbnail with one simple command, (2) how to interpret all statistical results on that plot and (3) why this test is sometimes called Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and why we shouldn't use this name</description>

      <title>R demo | Correlation Matrix | Danger or opportunity?</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2022-01-05-correlationmatrixinr</link>
      <description>Having several numeric variables, we often wanna know which of them are correlated and how. Correlation Matrix seems to be a good solution for it. But drawing conclusions from plain correlation coeffitients and p-values is dangerous, if we don't visualize the data. Let's learn a better way to produce a correlation matrix.</description>

      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2022-02-08-friedman</link>
      <description>The Friedman Test is a non-parametric brother of Repeated Measures ANOVA, which does much better job when data is not-normally distributed (which happens pretty often ;). Friedman test is also superior to Repeated Measures ANOVA when our data is ordinal (e.g., scales from 1 to 10). Friedman Test can also be a non-parametric father of the Paired Wilcoxon test, because it can compare more then two groups.</description>

      <description>Exploratory Data Analysis is an important first step on the long way to the final result, be it a statistical inference in a scientific paper or a machine learning algorithm in production. This long way is often bumpy, highly iterative and time consuming. However, EDA might be the most important part of data analysis, because it helps to generate hypothesis, which then determine THE final RESULT. Thus, in this post I'll provide the simplest and most effective ways to explore data in R, which will significantly speed up your work. Moreover, we'll go one step beyond EDA by starting to test our hypotheses with simple statistical tests.</description>

      <description>Hypothesis testing is one of the most important concepts in (frequentiest) statistics and science. However, most people who test hypotheses are scientists, but not statisticians. That's why scientists often do not test hypotheses properly, without any bad intensionс. So, in this blog-post we'll break down hypothesis testing in small parts and try to properly understand every of them.</description>

      <description>Why do we need p-values? Well, they help to **make decisions** and **answer the question whether we found something new or not**. But despite the fact that **p-values are** actually **useful**, they are **far from perfect**! And while everyone uses p-values, understanding them (and using them correctly) is very hard. The definition of the p-value from the book is often correct but rarely intuitive. Intuitive explanations are often not entirely correct. So, in this blog-post (and video) we’ll start with an intuitive (and not entirely correct) definition and will gradually build up the understanding of the p-value step by step. Thus, I don’t recommend to skip any part of this blog (or video). We’ll also talk about how to use and interpret p-values correctly in order to **make better decisions and better science**.</description>

      <title>Survival analysis 2: parametric survival models</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>

      <description>The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method (KM) can not describe survival probability by a smooth function, which means it can not predict anything. The parametric models (e.g. Exponential, Weibull etc.) can! Besides, in case where parametric models are appropriate, they are more exact, more effective and more informative than KM or Cox. However, unfortunately, this step is often left out due to the rear use of parametric models. In this post we’ll try to close this gap.</description>

      <title>R package reviews {performance} check how good your model is! </title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-03-r-package-reviews-performance-check-how-good-your-model-is</link>
      <description>There are several indicators of model quality, e.g. $R^2$ or AIC, and several assumption for every model which supposed to be checked, e.g. normality of residuals, multicollinearity etc.. R provides solutions for every indicator or assumption you can imagine. However, they are usually spread around different packages and functions. {performance} package brings all of quality indicators and all of the assumption under one roof. Thus, for me it became the one-stop solution for modelling.</description>

      <title>Survival analysis 1: a gentle introduction into Kaplan-Meier Curves</title>

      <description>Survival time analysis is necessary in any study which investigates the time to a particular outcome of interest. Cancer studies in the medicine and the first failure of the car in the engineering field (failure time analysis) are good examples. The outcome of interest could be death, remission to relapse, progression, or failure. Point in time of reaching that outcome is generally called the event. Thank goodness, not every “event” is fatal 😃, but can sometimes even be a favorable outcome such as discharge from hospital. And thus, survival analysis is also a generic term, because it is not only about survival.</description>

      <description>Data Scientists spend up to 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data for analysis. " Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" — Leo Tolstoy. "Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way" - Hadley Wickham. Thats when "janitor" helps to clean the mess.</description>

      <title>How to visualize models, their assumptions and post-hocs</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-01-how-to-visualize-models-their-assumptions-and-post-hocs</link>
      <description>A picture is worth a thousand words! This article shows how to visualize results of 16 different models in R: from a simple linear model to a multiple-additive-non-linear-mixed-effects model. Among them are logistic, multinomial, additive and survival models with and without interactions. **Goal: minimum R code &amp; maximum output!** We'll also go a bit beyond only model visualization. So, don't miss the bonuses 😉.</description>
