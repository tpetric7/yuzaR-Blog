      <description>How does education influence our salary? ANOVA which is just the abbreviation for Analysis Of Variances you see on the thumbnail answeres this question with Frequentists and Bayesian tests. It also privides two different effect sizes, compares education levels pairwisely and even corrects p-values for multiple comparisons. ALL OF THAT is done by this simple command. So, in this blog-post you'll learn how to produce the statistically rich plot, you'll understand when to conduct Welch's ANOVA and when Fisher's ANOVA and you'll know how to interpret every little detail on this plot. Lets get into it.</description>

      <description>If we have ordinal or not-normally distributed data, ANOVA might produce a wrong result. That's why we need Kruskal-Wallis test. Kruskal-Wallis test you see on the screen answers two question (1) whether at least one group is different from other groups and (2) between which groups exactly this difference is. So, let's learn how to get and interpret all these results.</description>

      <title>Tidy data (in progress, but really in progress mate ;)</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;If I had to summarize the whole idea of tidy data into one sentence,
I‚Äôd say: &lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúWhatever changes in your data, put it into a
column.‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why columns? Well, because it‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;the easiest way to store
similar data&lt;/strong&gt;, for example age or gender. So the data in a
column is similar, it belongs together, by it is not the same, it
varies. Age varies from 1 to 100, gender varies from male to female. And
since data varies in a column, &lt;strong&gt;a column is always a
variable&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;A variable is what we need to make any type
of analysis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="principles-of-tidy-data"&gt;Principles of tidy data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to summarize the idea of tidy data in three simple rules, I
would cite the creator of tidy data Hadley Wickham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;each column is a variable&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;each row is an observation&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;each cell is a single value&lt;/strong&gt; or only one peace of
information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app//posts/2022-04-22-tidydata/tidy-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of simplicity, let‚Äôs say that any other dataset which
does not follow these three rules is &lt;strong&gt;messy&lt;/strong&gt;. And the
problem with messy data is that it requires different strategies to
extract different variables. This slows down analysis and invites
errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of
cleaning and preparing the data &lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Data preparation is not just a first step,
but must be repeated many over the course of analysis as new problems
come to light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="does-messy-data-exist"&gt;Does messy data exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three rules of tidy data seem so obvious that you might wonder
whether messy datasets even exist. Well, unfortunately, most real world
data is messy, because there are soo many opportunities to mess things
up. Leo Tolstoy once said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúHappy families are all alike; while every unhappy family is
unhappy in its own way‚Äù Leo Tolstoy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúLike families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy
dataset is messy in its own way.‚Äù Hadley Wickham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, data is often organised to make entry as easy as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might think that tidy data is so obvious that it
is trivial. Surely, most data sets come in a tidy format, right? Wrong.
In practice, raw data is rarely tidy and is much harder to work with as
a result. Let me show you some typical cases I encountered the most and
how to fix them‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2
id="the-most-common-problems-with-messy-datasets-along-with-their-remedies"&gt;The
most common problems with messy datasets, along with their remedies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3
id="one-variable-is-stored-in-multiple-columns-column-headers-are-values-not-variable-names"&gt;One
variable is stored in multiple columns = Column headers are values, not
variable names&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app//posts/2022-04-22-tidydata/tidy-9.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different timepoints, for example years or days, are usually stored
in different columns. And while it might be convenient for recording
data, it‚Äôs hardly possible to analyse it, because a variable
&lt;strong&gt;year&lt;/strong&gt; does not exist, and we have no idea what those
&lt;strong&gt;numbers&lt;/strong&gt; are. Timepoints should represent different
observations! So, in our example, every combination of a country and a
year IS &lt;strong&gt;a single observation&lt;/strong&gt; of tuberculosis cases, and
with that - &lt;strong&gt;a single row&lt;/strong&gt;. Making a &lt;strong&gt;wide dataset
longer&lt;/strong&gt; creates two variables which can be immediately
analysed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="multiple-variables-are-stored-in-one-column"&gt;Multiple variables
are stored in one column&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app//posts/2022-04-22-tidydata/tidy-8.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorical variable, e.g.¬†gender have categories ‚Äúfemales‚Äù and
‚Äúmales‚Äù, which totally belong together. It‚Äôs important to separate
several &lt;strong&gt;categories&lt;/strong&gt; of the same variable,from Our column
&lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt; stores &lt;strong&gt;two different variables&lt;/strong&gt;
cases and population, which do not belong together, and thus can not be
analysed. To solve this problem we have to make a long table wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="more-then-one-value-in-one-cell"&gt;More then ONE value in ONE
cell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app//posts/2022-04-22-tidydata/tidy-17.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the third rule? &lt;strong&gt;Each value should be in its own
cell&lt;/strong&gt;. To fix this problem, we‚Äôll need to separate variable
‚Äúrate‚Äù into two variables ‚Äúcases‚Äù and ‚Äúpopulation‚Äù. Now, we could
actually create a real rate as a new column by dividing a column cases
by the column population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3
id="different-types-of-data-numbers-text-in-the-same-variable"&gt;Different
types of data (numbers &amp;amp; text) in the same variable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data can be either numbers or text. Mixing them into one column would
make the whole column a text. Thus, convert all values to either numbers
or text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="missing-values-are-mistreated"&gt;Missing values are
mistreated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this experiment, the &lt;strong&gt;missing value&lt;/strong&gt; represents an
observation that should have been made, but wasn‚Äôt, so it‚Äôs important to
keep it. &lt;strong&gt;Structural missing values&lt;/strong&gt;, which represent
measurements that can‚Äôt be made (e.g., the count of pregnant males) can
be safely removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3
id="matching-similar-but-not-identical-values-created-by-typos"&gt;matching
similar but not identical values (created by typos)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variables are stored in both rows and columns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most complicated form of messy data occurs when variables are
stored in both rows and columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-single-observational-unit-is-stored-in-multiple-tables."&gt;A
single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical example data for control and treatment groups are stored two
different Excel sheets or even two different files. Here again, we do
not have a variable &lt;strong&gt;groups&lt;/strong&gt;, while this is exactly what
we want - compare &lt;strong&gt;groups&lt;/strong&gt;. The solution is obvious -
combine all tables into a single table, one below the other, while
adding a column which describes groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="checklist-to-follaw"&gt;Checklist to follaw&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no empty rows,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no empty columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;empty cells (or missing values) are sometimes ok. Surprisingly, a
value can be missing in one of two possible ways:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly, i.e.¬†flagged with NA. Implicitly, i.e.¬†simply not present
in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs very important to separate missing values from zeros ;), because
missing value indicates missing information, while a zero is
infromation. For example, if you measured virus load in a cat, but did
not find any, a zero means that a cat is healthy and it‚Äôs important!
While if we could not take blood of the cat on Sunday, simply because
the host did not bring the cat over, we have an NA. Don‚Äôt put points or
text ‚Äúmissing‚Äù, or -77 into the cell with NA, just leave it empty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only the first raw is your header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no merged cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to think about the difference is with this Zen-like koan: An
explicit missing value is the presence of an absence; an implicit
missing value is the absence of a presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;simple is better the beautiful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn colors into variables, because statistics is colorblind, the
same applies to anything visual: italic, bold etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use short simple but still clear columns names, because long
explanational names you‚Äôd need to write them out and it hirts, and the
models look un√ºbersichtlich. Column ‚Äúd‚Äù, ‚Äús‚Äù do not communicate
information, ‚Äúdays‚Äù and ‚Äúspecies‚Äù do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a column should be either numeric or categorical, not
mixed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;avoid secial charakters, like @, ‚Ç¨, *, ^, (), because
&lt;code&gt;9a&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;9+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;9&lt;/code&gt; will be
considered as text and will screw up the variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if you want to show that some of the observations aren‚Äôt sure
(calibration error), create an column ‚Äúerror‚Äù and place 1 every time you
aren‚Äôt sure, and 0 every time you are sure about the measurement. That
would allow us to excude the data easily if we wish too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;remove unnecessary/unused columns and data, even if they are for
explanation, just create a copy of your table#&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;don‚Äôt summarize or explain something on the side or below the
table, because a software will try to incorporate the
information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if you plan to use R software don‚Äôt code categorical variables
into numbers, like sex 1 and 2, but write explicit words ‚Äúfemale‚Äù and
‚Äúmale‚Äù. For SPSS you might code them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if you thing your table will become too long, ‚Ä¶ stop thinking
that :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;use data and Filter function in Excel to check for spelling
errors, empty spaces, special characters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-to-organise-data"&gt;How to organise data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(random effects!!!!!!!!!) Fixed variables describe the experimental
design and are known in advance. Computer scientists often call fixed
variables dimensions, and statisticians usually denote them with
subscripts on random variables. Measured variables are what we actually
measure in the study. Fixed variables should come first, followed by
measured variables, each ordered so that related variables are
contiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to summarize the whole idea of tidy data into one sentence,
I‚Äôd say: &lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúWhatever changes in your data, put it in a column of
your spreadsheet.‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; Tidy datasets and tidy tools work hand in
hand to make data analysis easier, allowing you to focus on the
interesting domain problem, not on the uninteresting logistics of
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs much easier to learn what to do then what not to do,
we will see examples of messy data though. A standard makes initial data
cleaning easier because you don‚Äôt need to start from scratch and
reinvent the wheel every time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Cochran test is an extension of the McNemar test for comparing MORE than two PAIRED categorical samples in which the same individuals appear in each sample. If Cochran test is significant, we'd need to compare samples among each other pairwisely with McNemar tests. So, let's do that.</description>

      <description>Having several numeric variables, we often wanna know which of them are correlated and how. Correlation Matrix seems to be a good solution for it. But drawing conclusions from plain correlation coeffitients and p-values is dangerous, if we don't visualize the data. Let's learn a better way to produce a correlation matrix.</description>

      <description>If you need to compare two PAIRED categorical samples, McNemar test is a correct choise for you. Though, people often use Chi-Square test instead. Thus, in this blog-post we'll first conduct, visualize and interpret McNemac test you see on the picture to your right using only one simple command and then see what happens if we use Chi-Square test for paired data.</description>

      <title>R demo | Friedman Test | How to Conduct, Visualise and Interpret</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2022-02-08-friedman</link>
      <description>The Friedman Test is a non-parametric brother of Repeated Measures ANOVA, which does much better job when data is not-normally distributed (which happens pretty often ;). Friedman test is also superior to Repeated Measures ANOVA when our data is ordinal (e.g., scales from 1 to 10). Friedman Test can also be a non-parametric father of the Paired Wilcoxon test, because it can compare more then two groups.</description>

      <title>Deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R</title>

      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-09-exploratory-data-analysis-and-beyond-in-r-in-progress</link>
      <description>Exploratory Data Analysis is an important first step on the long way to the final result, be it a statistical inference in a scientific paper or a machine learning algorithm in production. This long way is often bumpy, highly iterative and time consuming. However, EDA might be the most important part of data analysis, because it helps to generate hypothesis, which then determine THE final RESULT. Thus, in this post I'll provide the simplest and most effective ways to explore data in R, which will significantly speed up your work. Moreover, we'll go one step beyond EDA by starting to test our hypotheses with simple statistical tests.</description>

      <description>Hypothesis testing is one of the most important concepts in (frequentiest) statistics and science. However, most people who test hypotheses are scientists, but not statisticians. That's why scientists often do not test hypotheses properly, without any bad intension—Å. So, in this blog-post we'll break down hypothesis testing in small parts and try to properly understand every of them.</description>

      <title>What is p-value and why we need it</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-07-31-p-value-intuitive-explanation</link>
      <description>Why do we need p-values? Well, they help to **make decisions** and **answer the question whether we found something new or not**. But despite the fact that **p-values are** actually **useful**, they are **far from perfect**! And while everyone uses p-values, understanding them (and using them correctly) is very hard. The definition of the p-value from the book is often correct but rarely intuitive. Intuitive explanations are often not entirely correct. So, in this blog-post (and video) we‚Äôll start with an intuitive (and not entirely correct) definition and will gradually build up the understanding of the p-value step by step. Thus, I don‚Äôt recommend to skip any part of this blog (or video). We‚Äôll also talk about how to use and interpret p-values correctly in order to **make better decisions and better science**.</description>

      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-06-survival-analysis-2-parametric-survival-models</link>
      <description>The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method (KM) can not describe survival probability by a smooth function, which means it can not predict anything. The parametric models (e.g. Exponential, Weibull etc.) can! Besides, in case where parametric models are appropriate, they are more exact, more effective and more informative than KM or Cox. However, unfortunately, this step is often left out due to the rear use of parametric models. In this post we‚Äôll try to close this gap.</description>

      <description>There are several indicators of model quality, e.g. $R^2$ or AIC, and several assumption for every model which supposed to be checked, e.g. normality of residuals, multicollinearity etc.. R provides solutions for every indicator or assumption you can imagine. However, they are usually spread around different packages and functions. {performance} package brings all of quality indicators and all of the assumption under one roof. Thus, for me it became the one-stop solution for modelling.</description>

      <description>Survival time analysis is necessary in any study which investigates the time to a particular outcome of interest. Cancer studies in the medicine and the first failure of the car in the engineering field (failure time analysis) are good examples. The outcome of interest could be death, remission to relapse, progression, or failure. Point in time of reaching that outcome is generally called the event. Thank goodness, not every ‚Äúevent‚Äù is fatal üòÉ, but can sometimes even be a favorable outcome such as discharge from hospital. And thus, survival analysis is also a generic term, because it is not only about survival.</description>
