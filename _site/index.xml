      <title>R package reviews {dlookr} diagnose, explore and transform your data</title>

      <description>Raw data need to be diagnosed for existing problems, explored for new hypotheses and repaired in order to increase data quality and output. The {dlookr} package makes these steps fast and easy. {dlookr} generates automated reports and performs compex operations, like imputing missing values or outliers, with simple functions. Moreover, {dlookr} collaborates perfectly with {tidyverse} packages, like {dplyr} and {ggplot2} to name just a few!</description>

      <title>Deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-09-exploratory-data-analysis-and-beyond-in-r-in-progress</link>
      <description>EDA is an important first step on the long way to the final result, be it a statistical inference in a published scientific paper or a Machine Learning Algorithm in production. This long way is often bumpy, highly iterative and time consuming. However, EDA might be the most important part of data analysis, because it helps to generate hypothesis, which then determine THE final RESULT. Thus, in this video I'll provide the simplest and most effective ways to explore data in R, which will signifiantly speed up your work. Moreover, we'll go one step beyond the EDA by starting to test our hypotheses by simple statistical tests.</description>

      <title>How to impute missing values with Machine Learning in R</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-03-04-how-to-impute-missing-values-in-r</link>
      <description>Imputation simply means - replacing a missing value with a value that makes sense. But how can we get such values? Well, we'll use Machine Learning algorithms, because they have a high prediction power. So, in this post we'll learn how to impute missing values easily and effectively.</description>

      <title>Survival analysis 2: parametric survival models</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-06-survival-analysis-2-parametric-survival-models</link>
      <description>The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method (KM) can not describe survival probability by a smooth function, which means it can not predict anything. The parametric models (e.g. Exponential, Weibull etc.) can! Besides, in case where parametric models are appropriate, they are more exact, more effective and more informative than KM or Cox. However, unfortunately, this step is often left out due to the rear use of parametric models. In this post we‚Äôll try to close this gap.</description>

      <title>R package reviews {performance} check how good your model is! </title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-03-r-package-reviews-performance-check-how-good-your-model-is</link>
      <description>There are several indicators of model quality, e.g. $R^2$ or AIC, and several assumption for every model which supposed to be checked, e.g. normality of residuals, multicollinearity etc.. R provides solutions for every indicator or assumption you can imagine. However, they are usually spread around different packages and functions. {performance} package brings all of quality indicators and all of the assumption under one roof. Thus, for me it became the one-stop solution for modelling.</description>

      <title>Survival analysis 1: a gentle introduction into Kaplan-Meier Curves</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-03-survival-analysis-1-a-gentle-introduction-into-kaplan-meier-curves</link>
      <description>Survival time analysis is necessary in any study which investigates the time to a particular outcome of interest. Cancer studies in the medicine and the first failure of the car in the engineering field (failure time analysis) are good examples. The outcome of interest could be death, remission to relapse, progression, or failure. Point in time of reaching that outcome is generally called the event. Thank goodness, not every ‚Äúevent‚Äù is fatal üòÉ, but can sometimes even be a favorable outcome such as discharge from hospital. And thus, survival analysis is also a generic term, because it is not only about survival.</description>

      <description>Data Scientists spend up to 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data for analysis. " Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" ‚Äî Leo Tolstoy. "Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way" - Hadley Wickham. Thats when "janitor" helps to clean the mess.</description>

      <title>How to visualize models, their assumptions and post-hocs</title>
      <dc:creator>Yury Zablotski</dc:creator>
      <link>https://yuzar-blog.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-01-how-to-visualize-models-their-assumptions-and-post-hocs</link>
      <description>A picture is worth a thousand words! This article shows how to visualize results of 16 different models in R: from a simple linear model to a multiple-additive-non-linear-mixed-effects model. Among them are logistic, multinomial, additive and survival models with and without interactions. **Goal: minimum R code &amp; maximum output!** We'll also go a bit beyond only model visualization. So, don't miss the bonuses üòâ.</description>
