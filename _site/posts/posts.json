All you need to create a website or a blog is R, RStudio and Netlify account. Moreover, it requires very little programming. It might not be too fancy, but it’s originally thought to make scientific publishing online, so, it can’t be too bad ;).\nFor a more advanced users, you might wanna use continuous deployment via Github, but you do not understand this sentence, you’ll be fine too.\nManual intermittent publishing (deploying)\nWhy should we do manual instead of automated and continuous first. Well, for non programmers or IT folks, like me, it might be very frustrating and painful to immediately go with the continuous deploy via Github. We all know what is “better” and “more effective”, but we turned off from doing something by complexity, we might never do what we want while thinking “it’s not my cap of tea”.\nIf you are comfortable with Github, click on the “Automated continuous publishing (deploying)” on table of contents on your left.\nInstall and load “distill” package\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"distill\")\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(distill)\n\n\n\nCreate your blog manually or with one line of code\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\nopen RStudio\nFile => New Project… => New Directory => Distill Blog\n“Directory name” will be the name of the folder, where all the documents from your blog will be stored\nChoose the directory where this folder supposed to be stored\nGive your blog a name. You’ll be able to rename it.\nClick “Create project”\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\nor execute the code below:\nThe easiest way to get started is to use the Distill Blog option in the RStudio New Project dialog:\n\n\ncreate_blog(dir = \"my blog\", title = \"A cool name of my blog\")\n\n\n\nKnit it\nThe “knit” button will show you how your website will look like. You can also open it in your browser.\nPublish your website via Netlify\nsing up for Netlify via Email (you’ll need to conferm your Email)\nIn “Team overview” you’ll see a window with: “Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site folder here”\nDrag and Drop your \"_sites\" into this window\nwait a bit and you’ll be getting a funny named website name, click on it\nContrats, you are online!\nGo to “Site settings” => Change site name => choose a “better-name” => Save\nClick on the “better-name.netlify.app” to make sure the name changed and the site is still working.\ngo back to RStudio and create a new post\nCreate a new blog-post\n\n\ndistill::create_post(\"My second blog post...this will be really good :-)\")\n\n\n\nthese new post are not on your local computer, but still not online, thus,\ngo back to Netlify => Deploys (tab) where you’ll see: “Need to update your site? Drag and drop your site folder here”\ndrag and drop the \"_site\" folder there and wait till “Production” (button) terns green and says Published.\nClick on the “better-name.netlify.app” to make sure the new blog-post appeared.\nAutomated continuous publishing (deploying)\nCreate blog either manually or with one line of code\nopen RStudio\nFile => New Project… => New Directory => Distill Blog\n“Directory name” will be the name of the folder, where all the documents from your blog will be stored\nChoose the directory where this folder supposed to be stored\nGive your blog a name. You’ll be able to rename it.\nClick “Create project”\nor execute the code below:\n\n\ncreate_blog(dir = \"my blog\", title = \"A cool name of my blog\")\n\n\n\nHave a look at your blog\nEither Knit the document, or go to the “Build” tab and press “Build Website”.\nConnect to your github\nYou have to have “git” installed on your computer and have a github profile. If you still aren’t, Happy Git and GitHub for the useR will help you with that. Take your time with this short, but comprehensive book.\nThen install “usethis” package, if you need:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n\n\n\nRun use_git() and answer two questions:\nRun “use_git()” command. You’ll be asked: “Is it ok to commit them?”\nDo not commit yet. Type 3 for “No”, or “Nope” or similar. You’ll get another question: “A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane Restart now?”\nDo restart! Type 2 for “Yes” or “Yup”.\n\n\nusethis::use_git() \n\n\n\nAfter restart you’ll see a “Git” tab near the Environment, History etc. That’s gut! ;) Click on the “Git” tab and you’ll see Empty boxed under “Staged”, lot’s of yellow question marks under “Status” and the documents names under “Path”.\nStage and Commit\nCheck all the boxes and press “Commit” button, which is between the “Status” and “History” tabs. A colorful window will pop up. This window will describe all the changes you are about to make to your blog.\nDefinitely describe what you have done for a future you, because then you’ll always be able to get back to this, in case something stops working. That’s what they call - a version control.\nWrite something like “first commit” and press “Commit”.\nClose or forget the window and go back to RStudio.\nRun use_github() to create a new Github repository\n\n\nusethis::use_github() \n\n\n\nA new repository will be automatically created on your Github profile and the new browser window with your Github will pop up.\nIf you’ll be asked: “Which git protocol to use?”, choose the one with “https” and if you’ll then be asked: “Are title and description ok?”, agree with “Yes” or “Ok” or similar.\nNOTE: if something else doesn’t work, get back to the “Happy Git” book and work through it. You’ll only need it once. Three main things you’d need to get working are:\ninstall git\nconnect RStudio to your Github and\nconfigure a GitHub Personal Access Token\nPublish your blog with Netlify\nIf you have a Notlify account you are fine, if not you can create one using your Github account. Then press:\n“New site from Git” in a green box\nClick on Configure Netlify on “GitHub”,\nChoose a newly created repository, you’ll recognise the name (“my blog”?).\nNOTE: Make sure to set the “Publish Directory” to \"_site\" (could be “docs” if you checked some boxes while creating new project)\nClick deploy!\nyou’ll get an absurd or funny random name for your website (e.g. gracious-mestorf-194a9f), which you immediatly by\nclicking “Site settings” => “Change site name”\nnow go on and click on the link of your blog. Congrats! Your blog is online! ;)\ngo back to RStudio and create a new post\nCreate a new blog-post\nrun following command in the Console:\n\n\ncreate_post(\"My second blog post...this will be really good :-)\")\n\n\n\na new RMarkdonw document will be created and opened.\nthese new post is only on your local computer, but still not online, thus,\n“Knit” the document\ngo to the “Git” tab and check all the boxes\npress “Commit”\nadd some description\nagain press “Commit”\nwait until you see the “Close” button and close “Git commit” pop up window\npress “Push”\nwait until you see the “Close” button and close “Git push” pop up window\nclose or ignore the other pop up window.\nGet back to your Webpage and refresh (it may take a few seconds, so, don’t panic if the first refresh don’t work). You should see a new blog-post.\nNow you can repeat following routine for every post: - Create or change posts - Knit - Commit - Push\nCongrats! You are continuosly deploy your online blog.\nImprove your website of blog\nlisting pages\ncategories\nthumbnail\ndate\nChange desing and appearence of your blog\n\n\n\nDifference between a website and a blog\nAll articles on a website are re-rendered when the site is rebuilt while the blog-post are not. We need to knit each of the article separately. This might sound bad first, because we are not uptodate with our blog, but I personally found it great. See, like the authors of “distill” state: “Given that R package upgrades have a tendency to break older code, continuously re-rendering old posts is nearly impossible to do without errors, especially over longer periods of time.” That happend to my old blogdown-generated website, where Hugo-Academic theme changes so dramatically that I could not modify my site anymore, and, since it was not on Github, I could not even ask R community, what is wrong. Thus, I totally understand, if you go for a manual deployment first (been there!), but I would recommend you to progress to Github and continuous deploy after you have got comfortable. Especially if you create a lot, automated deployment will save you lot’s of time. However, my old blogdown-website is still online and running. Thus, I prefer blog instead of the website.\nUseful ressources\nTom Mocks blog-post on how to build blogs with distill: https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/\n\n\n\n",
